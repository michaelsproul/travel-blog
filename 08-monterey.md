On Wednesday (September 24th) I travelled to Monterey for the Monterey Jazz Festival. The festival has been running for 57 years now and has hosted some of the best jazz artists ever, including Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, John Coltrane and John Scofield! I had initially planned to stay in San Francisco for 2 nights between Portland and Monterey, but decided to extend my stay in Monterey so that I could see something other than jazz. It took me 12 hours to travel from Portland to Monterey, on a series of 8 buses, trains and planes. I found daytime travelling to be quite agreeable compared to night-time travel - perhaps the hellish 16 hour flight from Sydney would have been more bearable during the day. Something that continues to surprise me about public transport in the US is how multicultural it is. Every bus I've been on has had signs doubled in English and Spanish. I've also seen Chinese (in Berkeley) and Vietnamese (near San Jose). For ages I thought Chinese was really prevalent, because I kept seeing road signs that read "PED XING". In a flash of enlightenment I realised this was actually just a shortening of "pedestrian crossing"...

On the bus from Salinas to Monterey I overheard some people at the back discussing one guy's recent release from jail, where he had spent 17 days for heroin possession. He was determined to attend the rehabilitation program and seemed like a nice guy. I am increasingly convinced that drugs should be treated as a medical problem rather than a criminal problem. The majority of drug-addicts I've seen have been damaged and deserving of pity, not punishment.

I arrived in Monterey in the early evening, the streets lined with jazz-themed bus stops and sea-sidey shops. After checking in to the hostel I allowed myself to be lured down to the sea by cool breezes and a few scenic glimpses between buildings. I stood on a deck by some shops looking out to sea for quite a while. It felt great to be back near the water, breathing salty air and watching the tide smash apathetically over the rocks. Although I'd been quite near the water in San Francisco, I didn't feel the same connection that I felt in Monterey. After revelling in the Monterey sunset for a few minutes I made my way to a restaurant recommended by the hostel staff.

The place was a Hawaiian grill called *Hula's* and seemed to be packed with most of Monterey's tourist population. In order to reduce the line outside the restaurant I agreed to share a table with another solo traveller. We both initially requested single tables, but decided to share when the waiter told us there was only one available. I sat at a table in the outdoor courtyard and introduced myself to Alexia, a girl of roughly my age from Switzerland. She was travelling around California for around 3 weeks and applying for jobs at a few start-ups in Silicon Valley! Although she was more focused on the business side of things we chatted about how fun it would be to work in a start-up, and agreed that working in tech does come with a few downsides, including a slightly juvenile culture (think nerf guns, Pokemon, etc). Before arriving in Monterey she had travelled to Lake Tahoe, and showed me some of the photos she'd taken. Being from Switzerland meant that she was also prolific in languages, speaking fluent English, French, Italian and German! I was amused to hear that conversations at home often involved switching between the four languages mid sentence! After a hearty Hawaiian beef burger, I walked back to the hostel, where Alexia was also staying. The Monterey hostel, being my second ever, had a different vibe to the only other hostel I had ever visited (in Portland). The living room was larger, with several couches, tables and even a piano! My bed was downstairs in a 16-person mixed dorm, and I slept reasonably the first night.

On Thursday I endeavoured to hire a bike and ride part of Monterey's 17-mile drive. Starting on Monterey's famous Cannery Row, I followed a bike path South-West along the coast-line, past expanses of calm Pacific Ocean. I stopped to watch some seals sunning themselves on a beach, framed by picturesque Northern hemisphere trees. At this first beach stop I also sighted my first otter, which I mistook for a seal because of its size - almost a metre long! Alongside a small crowd of other tourists I continued around the point, passing more beaches and rocky outcrops peppered with gulls. Like most things in America, the sea gulls here are larger than life, more akin to proper Albatrosses than weedy Australian sea gulls. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride but turned back in search of food at around 1pm.

On Thursday afternoon I didn't feel like doing much so I just sat by the water and started on my Portland blog posts. Monterey's waterfront reminds me slightly of Manly, but with less beaches and more large wooden buildings suspended over water. For dinner I sat on Cannery Row within earshot of some live music emanating from a nearby bar, eating a greasy foil-wrapped burger from a red-white-and-blue diner.

On Friday morning I chatted with some Zen Buddhists over a breakfast of hostel pancakes. I attempted to make up the pancake mix myself, but added too much water and ended up with thin misshapen crepes. The hostel staff watched me disapprovingly and ended up scraping my efforts into the bin without consultation! They set about making "proper American pancakes" for everyone, which were very thick and only slightly larger than pikelets. The Zen Buddhists were both white Americans aged in their 30s, one male and one female. We talked about some of the problems facing America and how easy it is to be labelled a communist (this involved the guy Buddhist shouting COMMUNIST in an inappropriately loud voice). They told me about the temple near Big Sur where they spend half the year "living a monastic life-style" and the other half "doing hard physical labour". They encouraged me to try labouring for 6 months, which naturally lead me to question what sort of labour could be so cathartic. It turns out the temple is also a resort for half of the year, and prospective monks can earn 6 months of monastic life by serving drinks and digging swimming pools for the other 6 months. Sound like a great deal? Come to California! I think the place is called [Esalen][esalen], but I'm not quite sure.

On Friday morning I washed some clothes at a local laundry and accidentally accrued $20 in quarters from a change machine in the process. Thankfully they didn't take too long to spend. At the laundry I met the first of many friendly middle-aged couples. Like many other people they told me how nice Santa Cruz is, how it is a hippy town and how it is full of drugs. The guy was *very* keen on Marijuana, telling me about the 7ft plants that he grows and how easy it is to get a "weed card". This re-affirmed my perception that Marijuana is treated very casually in California, despite technically being illegal. On Friday afternoon I published my Portland posts from the seaside and headed out to the festival on a "Jazz B" bus. Despite the name, the "Jazz" buses run all year 'round! I'll write up the Jazz Festival in another post, classes here have just started but I should have time in the next few days.
