So, this will be my travel blog. Kind of unneccessary, yes, but I'll take any excuse to make a shiny thing, and this blog looks pretty shiny through almost no work on my part.

Going to the US is starting to feel *real*, and I'm in two minds about it. On one hand, the US is home to great jazz and computer science, and I'm likely to have loads of fun studying and meeting new people. On the other hand, there'll be a period of about two weeks where I'll be travelling on my own, knowing *no-one*. Oh, and 7 months away from everyone I know...

I've also been shockingly bad at organising what I'm going to do in my first 2 weeks before Uni starts. So far I have a plane ticket to San Fran and some vague plans to visit Yosemite.
