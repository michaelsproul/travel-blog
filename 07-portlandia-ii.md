On Sunday I didn't do a whole lot. In the morning I walked down to Portland's downtown, near the old courthouse, mostly on a hipster pilgrimage to see the Portlandia statue. Portland's neighbourhoods are very organised, with the city split into 4 distinct regions around a river running more or less North-South. My hostel was in the North-West quarter of the city, where the neat grid of streets is numbered in one direction and alphabetical in the other! Check out [this map][map] if you don't believe me! As someone with a normally shocking sense of direction, this is something I think more cities should do! After a couple of days in Portland's west I was finding my way around like a local. I arrived at where the Portlandia statue was meant to be, early on Sunday morning, but couldn't find anything. My new-found faith in my navigation abilities suddenly diminished, and then returned as I spotted the statue on top of a nearby building - it was just much larger than I had thought! On my way to the statue I also stopped for icecream at McDonalds, and discovered that "30c" cones actually cost $1.35 in McDonalds' home country! Who would have thought? I suspect the dairy industry isn't as strong in the US.

After visiting the statue I walked along the river, and stumbled upon an outdoor piano. I impressed myself by fumbling through Autumn Leaves, a blues and a Chet Faker-esk *No Diggity*. I think being partially sleep deprived may have impacted how good I thought I was, but it was fun nonetheless and nobody told me to shut up. The hostel also had a guitar which I played a little while waiting in the lobby. From the river I continued back to the main part of town where I spent a few more hours in Powell's book shop. By Sunday night the idea of Pad Thai with hot chips had really got to me, so I returned to "Smile Thai" to try it. The waiter who had served me on Friday was there again and greeted me like a long lost friend (American restaurant staff only do "nice", whether or not the "nice" is annoying is another matter). I ordered the "Hybrid" Pad Thai with chicken, but when it arrived it came with prawns (or "shrimp" in US English). Upon re-reading the menu I realised that the hybrid didn't allow a choice of meats, so I decided to just suck it up and eat the bastards. The prawns were the "worst" part of the meal even though I tried to enjoy them, and the whole chip thing worked really well. The chips (fries) ended up being drenched in quite a lot of sauce, but remained quite crisp and were very enjoyable. With chicken, I would have rated the whole meal 8 or 9 out of 10.

On Monday I hung out with a 22 year old guy from Chicago named Ryan, who was in my room at the hostel. We attempted to visit the Portland Art Museum in the morning, but it seems Portlandians hate Mondays so much that they've decided not to work them at all, so it was closed. Instead we went to a history museum which had an exhibition on Abraham Lincoln and the history of Oregon. The exhibitions were interesting, but we were both more interested in talking about politics, and left after a few hours. We got glared at by some older museum-goers for talking while they were trying to watch videos or read walls of text. They were probably the most unfriendly Americans I've met. We had lunch at a Japanese place in between museum exhibits. Ryan seemed like a nice guy, and was very well travelled, having been to 24 states! After the museum we went back to the old courthouse where a Mexican festival was taking place. We had Ben and Jerry's icecream and then continued to Portland State University. Ryan is studying Biology, and wanted to check out the quality of PSU for potential transfer purposes. There really wasn't a lot going on at the uni by 6pm so we parted ways, Ryan riding off into the city (he wheeled a bike around the whole day for this purpose) while I plodded for half an hour back to the hostel.

At 8pm on Monday night I made it to Jimmy Mak's, the jazz club I had intended to visit earlier. From the first note the band played that this was my sort of gig. The group was a trio, lead by guitarist Dan Balmer, who I'm told is something of a legend in the Pacific Northwest. They played a bunch of original compositions with modern grooves and intricate harmonies. I was reminded of the many James Muller gigs I've been to in Sydney. I had a burger - one of many eaten in Portland - and lied about my age in order to stay past 9:30pm. "Are you 21?", "Yes". Too easy. During the break I bought a cheap CD and chatted to Dan and some other guitar enthusiasts about my travels. Dan recommended visiting Seattle, and I had to explain that I probably wouldn't make it up there. Various people (Dan included) also spoke highly of Santa Cruz, and I'm now quite looking forward to arriving (partly for the return to a *routine*). Although I like travelling, I've found I'm more relaxed doing nothing. In an effort to keep bits of my past life I've been writing code every now and then on planes and in airports, and reading about [Haskell][haskell] on my phone late at night when I can't sleep. Rather than finding this stressful, I've actually found it gives me focus and helps me relax. Anyway, I was really impressed by the jazz in Portland, and loved being able to just sit and chillll.

My approach to planning (last-minute) has served me well for the majority of my trip, but kind of turned against me in Portland. I wanted to get out into the natural beauty of Oregon state, but without a car I was dependent on a bus tour for transport. Of the two companies running tours, one didn't have any good ones on while I was there and the other didn't return any of my four phone calls. Come Tuesday I felt in need of some nature so I did the next best thing and hiked through Washington Park up to Pittock Mansion. The mansion is a lovely old building on a hill to the north of the city, with views all the way to Mount Hood. That is, there are views when the city isn't shrouded in smoke... There were a few fires around Portland when I was there, so I didn't see the mountain at all, and finally understood the source of my allergies and asthma (I hadn't previously smelt the smoke). I still enjoyed the walk though, particularly the exotic trees and the squirrels! My eyes aren't quite used to North American vegetation and I still marvel at the most basic pines, not to mention the towering Redwoods. Every so often I spot a gum tree out of the corner of my eye and feel the urge to tell people about it (normally I keep this urge in check). I am surprised by how often this happens- there being are a lot of Australian trees up and down the west coast.

On Tuesday night I packed my bags for a 6am start the following day and talked to a guy from New Zealand who had just arrived at the hostel. I am now in Monterey, sitting facing the water, and will write a bit more about that soon. Until then, adios!
