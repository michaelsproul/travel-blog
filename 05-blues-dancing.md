To complete my Wednesday I went to a blues dancing class with Jet. He had spoken highly of it, and I figured I'd enjoy it given my love of blues of jazz. I started off in a beginner's class at 8pm, where they taught us the basic moves. Blues dancing is a form of partially-improvised partner dancing, kind of like jazz! The instructors guided us through several different steps, with everyone changing partners every five minutes or so. We learnt how to 1, 2 and 4 step, all of which are basically just stepping side to side. We also learnt the blues etiquette for turns. In traditional blues dancing there are two roles, a leader and a follower, typically played by the male and the female (in a hetero-normative patriarchal society). To initiate a turn, the "lead" raises their hand to one side and gives the "follow" a gentle nudge. The turning partner then goes solo for a bit (about a bar seems to be most comfortable) before (possibly awkwardly) rejoining the other person. Getting the timing right on the re-join proved to be tricky. Another standard move that I found quite hard was the synchronised walking, where both partners move towards/away from each other, rather than side to side. Signalling changes in direction without talking seems like some kind of blues voodoo! I found I had to concentrate quite a bit, although I imagine with more experience everything would feel more natural.

The gender dynamics in a community blues dance session are quite interesting. During the class, everyone danced with everyone because of the rotation enforced by the instructors, but once the class ended and the more experienced dancers took the floor, everyone seemed to stick to male-female pairings. There was also an expectation for men to lead, although I did my bit to dismantle the patriarchy by volunteering to follow and by dancing with other guys. It's not like people dancing in a community class intend on gettin' it on, so what's the big deal about genders? There was a versatile mix of people, and nobody seemed to show any other preferences (I also danced with a bunch of old ladies).

The music for the open jam was really cool, starting with classic blues tunes and moving to some more modern stuff later in the night. At the start of the open jam Jet leapt in and started dancing with a girl I assumed was his regular dancing partner. They whirled around like crazy for a bit, and I was very impressed. I later found out that they'd just met! Like jazz, there's a collection of knowledge around blues dancing that allows people who have never met to coordinate an improvised dance without talking! Dancing with the more experienced people I discovered that the basic steps I'd learnt in the class offered only a slight insight into true blues dancing. I quickly found myself fumbling all over the place and unsure of what to do. It was still a lot of fun though, and I did have a few good dances. People seemed compelled to change partners at the end of each song, although I'm not sure if this is a general blues dancing thing or something specific to community events. Either way it meant that I ended up dancing with almost everyone in the room at least once (about 30 people). I reacted enthusiastically when the DJ starting playing The Waifs towards the end of the night! It was great to hear Australian music selected by such discerning people! The song was [Flesh and Blood][flesh-and-blood], which I instantly recognised from its distinctive beginning. The change in music was also accompanied by a change in style - "blues fusion" - as Jet described it. People loosened up and started straying more from the formula we'd been given in the lesson. Apparently Chet Faker also gets played in such sessions, which would be awesome.

Blues dancing is awesome, and I definitely want to do it again. I'm tempted to go again next week when I get back from Portland, but I'll see how easy it is to get to from wherever I end up staying. Unfortunately it seems that most blues dancing is centred around San Francisco, with very little happening elsewhere in the world. That said, I will still try to find some when I get back to Sydney, or else I could use the voucher to free latin dance classes that I've had for well over 2 years now...

Until next time!
