Yesterday I rode my bike over the Golden Gate Bridge, which was pretty awesome. I took a free bus to the BART station by dishonestly flashing Jet's student card, then caught the train to "16th Street Mission" in the heart of San Fran. Upon emerging from the station I was aware of a marked change in feel. Although the streets of Berkeley smell of marijuana and there are lots of homeless people, for the most part it feels safe. Where I was in the mission district contained more more surly bunches of men, more drug-damaged people and more smoke shops. I had no idea smoke shops were even a thing until I arrived in the US. They sell cigarette paraphernalia and have narrow, dingy interiors framed by neon lights and Bob Marley posters. I had seen a few in Berkeley, but in Mission there was one in every direction I turned my head. On the whole the Mission district felt more like a poor communist country than the wonderful USA. I suppose that's how gross inequality works.

From the Mission district I was set to catch a bus down to the Golden Gate Park, the only problem being that I could no longer ride for free by impersonating a UC Berkeley student. After receiving a variety of wild misinformation from people I asked (including a bus driver!) I eventually discovered that tickets can only be purchased on board, or pre-arranged using an Opal-like system. Foolishly, I opted to buy a ticket on board, only to discover that buses don't give change! The smallest money I had was a $10 note, so I was forced (advised?) to buy 4 tickets for the 2-hour period from 11am until 1pm. Fortunately I was able to sell two to the people behind me, which left me with only 1 spare and a loss of $3.25. I can't imagine a system that can blatantly steal your money going down well in Australia, although I admire the desire to speed up trips. Once I'd finally made it onto a bus I was carried into the gentrified suburbs which are a little closer to the water. Lots of big colourful wooden houses like the ones in Mrs Doubtfire (the film I've seen most recently set in San Fran).

Upon arriving at the Golden Gate park I had lunch at another little Thai place, on Haight St. The street was blocked off for a festival, so I had the pleasure of listening to an arrhythmic layering of hip hop and country music as I ate. I then hired a mountain bike (because it was large) and a slightly too-small helmet from a bike rental guy wearing ear plugs and rode off into the park. I had expected the park to contain a lot of grass and some paths but it seemed to mostly consist of wide roads surrounded by trees. I'm not sure if I saw the good bits of the park, but I rode around a bit and felt a little underwhelmed (I didn't see the bridge from the park, because it's quite far away). I decided to head for the bridge, following the directions given to me by the bike rental guy. The route to the bridge initially took me through some more of the park, and then out into the city, down some nice streets with bike lanes. I resisted the urge to shout "cyclist's rights!" at anyone, although it was pretty tempting, and I might try it in Portland(ia). I got a bit lost, but managed to find my way by heading in the general direction of the bridge and following other people on bike pilgrimages. My first glimpse of the bridge was from the top of a hill a few kilometers away, where I also made the mistake of riding (gently) off a gutter. The bike made a dodgy crunching sound, but seemed ok at first. As I got closer to the bridge, the bike became harder to ride and I realised that the back brake pad was rubbing about once every revolution. At a lookout I enlisted the help of a Seattle local with a large camera who looked like he might know about bikes. We flipped the bike over and worked out that the wheel was bent - brilliant. Despite the injured bike, I kept going with my quest to cross the bridge and reach Sausalito. I was only really a third of the way there, but it was still early (2:30pm) and it doesn't get dark until about 8pm.

The ride across the bridge was very pleasant. Hundreds of people on bikes stream across every hour, a mixture of tourists, commuters and people in lycra. The lycra crowd got pretty annoyed by all the tourists stopping to take photos and clogging up the rather narrow bike lane. It was very windy on the bridge, but the structure impressively didn't sway *at all*. Being San Francisco there were some cool signs along the way that talked about the maths and engineering behind the bridge. Best tourist signs ever! On the other side of the bridge I followed a track down the other side of the bay to a small town called Sausalito. It looked wealthy, like a glammed-up South Coast town. Think boutique shops, fancy harbour-side restaurants and gelto shops. I was tempted to stop for gelato but opted to get in line for the ferry so that I could get home before it got too late. I got a free ferry ticket from James (the Seattle photographer), which allowed me to dodge one of the queues. We stood at the front of the ferry taking photos of the bridge, the city and Alcatraz. Upon reaching San Francisco I dropped the bike back at the wharf (for an extra $5) and caught the BART from the unpronounceable Embarcadero (embarc-a-derro) to Downtown Berkeley. In the evening I finished off my previous blog post and had a burger with Jet at a local place.
