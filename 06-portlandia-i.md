Last Friday (the 12th), I travelled to Portland after exactly one week in the US. I made a batch of Spaghetti Bolognese for 10 as a farewell present for the Berkeley house. After some initial trouble with the preparation (cooking 1.5kg of Turkey mince is hard!), I think I managed to pull it off. It was well received nonetheless. Getting to Portland was quite straight-forward, I caught a plane from Oakland. I stayed in a Hostelling International hostel in the north-west of the city, which is about an hour from the airport on a MAX train (the US seems to favour boy's names when naming public transport - I've seen BART and MAX so far). Portland instantly felt different from both SF and Berkeley, in ways that I appreciated. The city centre is filled with shops, restaurants and pubs which give way to artsy warehouses and grand wooden houses framed by trees in the suburbs. Unlike in San Francisco, I saw no evidence of poverty on my train ride into the city. Even the yards filled with trucks and shipping containers seemed clean and pleasant in comparison to Oakland's dusty and graffiti-plastered industrial area. Portland's weather surprised me, as I arrived in an unseasonably hot spell. I felt slightly deceived by Portlandia, which had lead me to believe that the sun is "hidden by a thin layer of cloud" in Portland. I did some lazy Googling for a temperature but got pissed off when everything came back in Fahrenheit, changeable only through fiddly menus. When I bothered to look at the weather properly on Saturday I found out it was actually 32 degrees, at 7pm too! Having not had Thai for at least 24 hours, and feeling quite at home, I had dinner at a Thai place about 150m from the hostel. I noticed that the restaurant listed a "Pad Thai Hybrid" amongst its specials, consisting of Pad Thai served with hot chips! Tempted though I was by this bizarre offering, I opted for regular Pad Thai and let the concept linger in the back of my mind for a few days.

On Saturday morning I ventured down to the river in search of the Saturday Markets and Voodoo Doughnuts, both of which are quite famous and had been mentioned to me by numerous people. I got the markets at around 9:50am and was surprised to see they hadn't started yet - things move slowly in Portland! I wandered around chatting to a few of the shop keepers about their wares, and had an interesting conversation with a lady selling ironic tshirts with slogans like "Gluten is the new Al Quada". I mentioned how easy-going and peaceful Portland seemed and she politely pointed out that I probably felt this way because everybody in Portland is white... Looking around, I realised she was right, and felt kind of bad for having mentioned it. I hope that Portland's vibe isn't a result of racial segregation, but it could be possible given the focus that Americans place on race. When filling in official documents I've always had to list my race, as if that were in some way relevant. Some Canadians in the hostel told me that they had to list their race when filing a police report about some stolen bikes. They couldn't find "white" in the vast list of possibilities and ended up putting "White/Arab", partly out of irreverence I think (and mostly out of a desire to complete the stupid form). The rest of the Saturday Markets (which also run on Sundays...) were quite enjoyable, although I ended up mostly just talking to people and didn't buy much. There were lots of nice hand-made things though, and I surprised myself by browsing for much longer than I normally would have. It struck me that the markets in Sydney and Melbourne are probably very similar!

After the markets I went to Voodoo Doughnuts, which is a psychedelic doughnut shop with a Mighty Boosh feel. I wouldn't have been surprised to see someone in green facepaint with a monocle behind the counter but wasn't disappointed by the guy wearing a beard net, which I assume was for hygienic rather than aesthetic purposes. Due to the shop's notoriety, the line was ridiculously long and snaked down the street around a barricade painted in the store's customary bright pink. While waiting, a guy came past and started yelling about how we were being lead into a tourist trap to be robbed. He seemed quite ordinary, but I think he was probably high. After a few expletive laden exchanges with the shop's employees the police were called and he started wandering away. I was amused to see a police officer arrive by bike, about 5 minutes after the man had disappeared. He had seemed quite casual throughout the whole exchange, probably because he knew the police would take so long to arrive! Nonetheless, I was impressed by Portland's green credentials. They also have compost street bins bearing the slogan "Portland Composts!" and recycling bins in the streets. Pretty cool!

I spent Saturday afternoon browsing Powell's bookstore, which is the largest independent book shop in the world, with over one million books. It sprawls across several levels, and has a whole separate building for sciencey stuff. Despite the vast selection, there was nothing on Type Theory or Category Theory (obscure branches of theoretical computer science). I bought a few normal books as presents for presents for various people who will remain nameless. For dinner I went to a fast-food place specialising in noodles from around the world (Noodles & Company). As well as various Asian noodle dishes they also serve Italian noodles. I had an Italian noodle thing that I can't quite recall the name of, with onion, pesto and slices of chicken. It was pretty delicious for fast food.

Earlier in the day I also visited a music shop and chatted with the old hippie guy running it. He urged me to buy a $100 guitar (which I didn't) and visit a jazz club called Jimmy Mak's (which I did). I planned to go to Jimmy Mak's on Saturday night, but misread the schedule and missed the gig I actually wanted to see. At the last minute I searched for more jazz in Portland and found a band lead by [Greta Matassa][greta] playing at a restaurant nearby. After listening to 30 seconds on her website, I grabbed my trusty drink bottle and bolted up there. I paid $10 to get in, but was also informed as I arrived that I'd have to spend $7/hour! I tried to use my Australian/Sproul charm on the doorman, but it didn't work and he didn't want to waive the $7 crap. I sat by the bar and decided to half participate in their game by ordering gelato. The music was great, just good solid straight-ahead jazz. Greta had great control over her voice and phrasing, and sang numerous scat solos. It was refreshing to hear a vocalist scat so much, even top Australian vocalists like Kristin Berardi typically only scat on a few tunes per set (possibly to avoid scaring the audience). The band were also top notch, burning through fast tunes without issue and improvising creatively. I struck up a conversation with the 40-something guy at the bar next to me, who turned out to be an anti-GMO activist from Ohio called Denny. Although I'm not overly opposed to genetically modified food, I managed to agree with him that foods containing GMOs should be labelled and that all GMOs should be well tested and unpatented. He seemed to be a bit more passionate about the issue, so we talked about other environmental issues instead, like fracking and climate change! He said he was heartened to meet a young person fighting against corporate bullshit, and we parted on a positive note (he had an overnight bus to catch). Upon leaving the venue I didn't have to pay for anything extra apart from the gelato, which was only $5.

I didn't sleep particularly well for my first few nights in Portland, partly because it was so hot. I was in a room with 5 other guys, one of which snored quite badly. After a crappy night's sleep on Friday I set about constructing a blanket tent for myself, to block out the light from the street and the noise of the fan which was propping the window open. Despite combining this setup with earplugs, I *still* didn't sleep very well. My allergies were also bad, and I had numerous nose bleeds over the course of my stay. Eventually I settled in by embracing the chaos of the room (no earplugs, no attempts to block out light). Even when I was sleeping badly, I still quite enjoyed the hostel vibe. I met some Australians, but we didn't have a lot in common and didn't say much more than pleasantries. I hit it off quite well with a guy from Chicago who had moved to Portland to work in a glass art place. On this trip I've forgotten numerous people's names, and his was one of them. In introductions you get someone's name once and if you don't hear it properly or don't really hammer it home you've got no hope! I find I get distracted by the other stuff they're saying, only to later regret missing their name (but maybe I'm just socially challenged). In my mind, and in messages to Emma, I referred to this guy as Nick, due to his uncanny resemblance of Nick Miller from New Girl. During my time in the hostel I was able to watch the unfortunate narrative of his trip unfold. He started work on Tuesday, and was also due to check out of the hostel the same day. On the weekend he had planned to put a deposit on a flat, but everything went awry when his backpack containing $400 was stolen from a McDonalds by some homeless children. As someone moving to Portland, he had no travel insurance and no course of compensation to pursue. He told me the bag also contained some irreplaceable journals and books, which I thought was both surprising and tragic, and partially earned him his Nick Miller nickname (he otherwise looks quite macho - tattoos, etc). On Monday he was getting desperate for a place to stay, as all the hostels in town were full and he didn't have the money for a hotel. We joked about him going to live in the woods and getting eaten by a bear, or living with the homeless children who stole his bag. After a little while I thought to tell him about [AirBnB][air-bnb], which is a trendy web service that allows people to rent out their unused rooms. He hadn't heard of it, and spent a while browsing the available offerings. None of them were immediately suitable, being either too far away or too expensive. When I last saw him on Tuesday morning he wasn't sure what he was going to do, and I don't know if he ended up in the woods, or an AirBnB couch...

This has turned out to be quite a long post, so I'll write about the rest of my time in Portland in another post!
