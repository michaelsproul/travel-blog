UC Berkeley and More San Fran
====

On Monday and Tuesday I attended a few lectures at UC Berkeley to see how they compared to lectures at Sydney Uni. The first one I went to was a statistics one with Jet, which was well taught but seemed quite basic for a third year course. I suspect this was mostly because it was still only week 3. I correctly answered a question about the Taylor series expansion of e^x when nobody else seemed they were going to, which was fun! I figured I may as well get the full student experience. I'm not ready to call a winner between UCB maths and USYD maths based on such a small sample, but USYD maths is pretty great anyway.

After the stats lecture I did some shopping at Trader Joe's, which Jet tells me is like an American ALDI. I didn't see any brands I recognised and in my hunt for decent cereal all I managed to get were Trader Joe's Bran Flakes. Unlike Sultana Bran, there's literally nothing in the box apart from flakes, which would be fine if the flakes tasted *right*, but they don't and I was left wanting Weet-Bix. Most of the other cereals I saw followed a bland naming formula fixated on the letter 'O': Cheerios, Fairy 'O's, Sugar 'O's, etc. Interestingly, Americans seem to be even more obsessed with ingredient bans than Australians. Although the milk didn't claim to be "permeate-free" (which is an Australian fear campaign, as exposed on [The Checkout][the-checkout]) it did claim to be "rBST free". rBST is a synthesised cattle hormone that is used to increase milk production, and by the box's own confession: "No significant difference has been shown between milk derived from cows treated with artificial hormones and those not treated with artificial hormones.". It looks like marketing has won against science yet again, just like Australia!

On Tuesday I snuck into two computer science lectures that I looked up using the UC Berkeley Schedule of Classes, freely available online. The first lecture was for a course on Programming Languages and Compilers, which I've found myself increasingly interested in recently. In a bizarre coincidence I bumped into [Alan Fekete][fekete], a Professor from USYD's School of IT! He's at Berkeley as a visiting scholar doing research, and was (like me) checking out Berkeley's approach to computer science courses. We agreed that some of the choices were unusual (writing compilers in JS), but that on the whole Berkeley is rather awesome. I had a chat to him about honours options, and he suggested I check out Macquarie University's programming languages group. He didn't speak favourably of UNSW, which I am also considering along with Sydney.

After my chat with Alan I continued to a second computer science lecture on Artificial Intelligence (which I don't think is is anywhere near as exciting as it sounds). I hadn't planned to go until Alan told me it was being given by [Start Russell][russell], who authored the textbook used by hundreds of universities, including USYD when I did the course last semester! Being only the third week he was still talking about quite basic algorithms, although he did give a beautifully clear proof of A\*'s optimality. Sorry for the density of technical jargon in this post, I'm trying to keep it to a minumum, and hoping you can still get the gist of what I'm saying by replacing the nonsense words with "blah". Anyway, the lecture was good, and I met a friendly guy from Singapore studying at Berkeley full-time (and paying the fees!). After three lectures I still don't feel confident enough to make a judgement about UCB vs USYD, we'll see how I go after 6 months at Santa Cruz.

On Wednesday I abandoned my student facade and embraced being a tourist again. With a floppy widebrim hat atop my head and daggy year-8 sunglasses on my face, I strode out into the streets of San Fran once more. From Googling "things to do in San Francisco" I had decided to visit Fishermen's Wharf and the de Young art gallery in Golden Gate Park. I caught the BART to the edge of the city and then a vehicle known only to the locals as the "F car" (it's actually just a tram). Fisherman's Wharf is quite touristy, so I wandered around some shops and took a few photos of the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and the Bay Bridge (to Oakland). One of the better shops was a puzzle shop selling tricky wooden puzzles. I solved a few and half-solved a rather difficult one, which I gave up on in order to go have lunch. I sat in a restaurant overlooking the water eating a chicken burger whilst polite waiters swanned about. To be honest I much prefer Australian restaurants, because the staff aren't going out of their way to attempt to impress you (which is usually mildly annoying). Call me a bastard, but bring on a higher minimum wage and lazy waiters!

After lunch I caught the bus over to Golden Gate Park, this time without losing any of my money to the merciless ticket machine. The bus driver was kind enough to announce the various attractions available at each stop, but did so through a tinny speaker system in an accent that I couldn't help but smirk at. For fans of The Mighty Boosh, he was exactly like Bob Fossil. I made a recording of him which I present to you now as an absurd piece of art music: [here][fossil].

The art gallery itself was very enjoyable. I started out in the abstract modern sections, which were probably my favourite, before moving to a section about the art of America. The American art included indigenous artworks from centuries ago, alongside colonial portraits, still-lifes and a few modern pieces. Amongst them, a couple of paintings by Salvador Dal√≠ and Picasso! The gallery building is also very cool. It's a large and jagged metal box that juts out of the trees and grass of the park. The high metal tower block also affords great views across the city and the park. With lowered expectations, I really enjoyed my second visit to the Golden Gate Park.
