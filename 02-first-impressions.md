I've been in the US for nearly 2 days now, and already I can feel the initial culture shock fading. Flying in via LA was daunting - from the air it's a sprawling grid of identical houses, warehouses and highways. I think it was the size that got to me, unashamedly huge and American, and unlike anything in Australia. From LA I flew to San Fran on a small plane packed with young LA holiday-makers who were evidently intent on hitting San Fran's "nightlife". The mass of burly dudes in singlets and fake-tanned girls with iPhones chattering in abrasive tones was almost enough to turn my stomach, especially after 15 hours flying and no real sleep. My very first impressions of the US weren't great and I kept thinking I was in a B-grade film (or 'Flying High/Airplane').

Things improved once I landed in San Fran, which was much warmer than I expected and less plagued by fake-looking people. I took the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) train to Downtown Berkeley with one smooth change in Oakland. San Fran's train network is somewhat simpler than Sydney's, with only 2 main corridors, but it seems to work really well. In Berkeley I met up with schoolfriend Jet, who is studying at UCB and graciously agreed to let me stay at his place (thanks man!). We wandered around Berkeley a bit that night, including a stop for enormous pizza slices at Artichoke pizza. We also went to a super-hip concert in a stairwell performed by UCB group 'Mad Noise'. After my trek across the pacific the music was incredibly soothing. I crashed onto a mattress in the front room of Jet's large wooden share house at about 10:30pm and didn't wake until 9am the next day.

On Saturday morning I ventured into Berkeley on my own in search of breakfast and a supermarket. I had a croissant and a jam bagel at a little cafe south of UCB. I was hoping I could get pancakes or something, but this cafe seemed to do very little in the way of on the spot food preparation (lots of stuff in display cases). I then headed to the downtown, which I vaguely knew from walking around with Jet on Friday night. Alas, I didn't find the supermarket I had looked up before I left. US phone plans are ridiculously overpriced, so I am without Google maps constantly guiding me. In the downtown I spoke to some friendly phone shop assistants who confirmed that I couldn't get a phone plan for less than $50/month with any of the major providers... Since then I've discovered a few more things that I plan to check out tomorrow (Monday).

Saturday was also "game day", which is unfortunately sports related, and not a day of board games as I initially thought upon hearing the phrase. Basically, it's an excuse for everyone to get really drunk (and high), particularly in the "frats". As far as I can make out, the frats are also largely an excuse for drinking, and are generally pretty horrible (sort of like alcohol cults). I was invited to a "frat party" (with a water slide jumping castle) as part of the game day festivities but declined because I was planning to visit SF. I wanted to go to Golden Gate Park, but it was too late in the day so I searched for parks near Berkeley and found a rose garden on the north side. At about 1pm I started walking up there, through Berkeley's grid of streets and along frat avenue (not its real name). I wanted to take photos of how hedonistic it was but refrained in the interest of my own safety. There were lots of guys without shirts, barbecues, couches on front lawns, drunk people dancing on tables and American flags. Yeah... As a middle-aged man trapped in a young man's body, I greatly preferred the rose garden. It was nice just to sit and relax out of central Berkeley, away from noise and parties. From the rose garden I could also see out to San Fran, although it was quite foggy and I could only just make out the bridge. On my way back from the rose garden I had a nice lunch at a Thai place on the awesomely-named Euclid avenue. Some restaurants do this weird thing where you have to sort your plates into washing up containers when you've finished and I've since learnt that this magically removes your obligation to tip (I am now very thankful for the minimum wage in Australia). The lady in the restaurant didn't think I sounded Australian, which I thought was funny, so I did some bogan impersonations to convince her I wasn't English.

Saturday night was fairly uneventful, I had oversize pizza again and got lost on campus looking for an improv comedy show.
